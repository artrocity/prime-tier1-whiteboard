# TASK 
    Whiteboard Interview Introduction
    This is often a part of a technical interview. The same, Who, How, What, Where, and Why still apply.
    
    Each member of the group should pick a problem and talk through the solution out loud one person at a time. Start by trying to solve the problem without looking at the answer. If you get stuck, explain what you expect as inputs and outputs. Reference the solution if needed to finish          talking through the solution.
  
# Fundamentals of Whiteboard Problem:
    Make your best attempt at solving the problem
    Ask for clarification
    Draw a few input outputs (“Yellow” -> “Blue”) to confirm
    Think out loud.
    Making mistakes is better than doing nothing.
    Admit when you don’t know things. “I’m not really sure, but this is how I might start…”
    Ask questions when you get stuck or if you start making up functions, “I think strings have a .split() function that does these nice things for me? Is it ok to use this?”.
    Be honest about your strengths and weaknesses
    When you are done, test your solution, walk through it, try to think of edge cases that would break it.
    Don't stop thinking out loud.
